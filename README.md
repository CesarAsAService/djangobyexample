# Django By Example
I'll use the book [Django By Example] (https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/django-example) as a guide on my path as a django apprentice.

Today a have a basic notion of what it is Django and it's capable of. But I've just scratched the surface, so I consider that these will my firsts complete projects using it.

The book covers a few projects that I'll separate them into directories.

I don't know how regular I'll be updating this repo, but the goal is to do a least one commit per day.

So, be free to open issues and discuss changes or fixes, I'd love to to.
